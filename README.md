About
-------------------------------

Atmosphere-O is a custom stylesheet for deviantart.

A custom stylesheet (or userstyles) is a script with a bunch of pseudo-code that will change the aspect of any website, it's kind like make-up I guess : you'll be able to change/modify the visual of the elements of the page (background, icon, buttons, etc...) and even delete some useless stuff.


Instruction
-------------------------------

<strong>Step 1 : Install Stylish</strong>

<span>Depending of your browser.</span>
<ol>
<li>for <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/">Mozilla Firefox</a></li>
<li>for <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylish-custom-themes-for/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe?hl=en">Google Chrome</a></li>
<li>for <a href="https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/stylish/">Opera</a></li>
<li>for <a href="http://sobolev.us/stylish/">Safari</a></li>
<li> for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.pmmlabs.stylish&amp;hl=en">Dolphin</a></li>
</ol>

<strong>Step 2 : Install the script </strong>
<ol>
<li> Via <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/144757/atmosphere-o-da-css">userstyles</a> : click the button <i>install Style</i> and it's done.</li>
<li> Or <a href="https://pastebin.com/r3bqsuuv">manually</a> : create a new style in Stylish and copy/paste the script in it. The script was written for Firefox Mozilla, that's why for Google Chrome and such, you'll have to click the button <i>Import from Mozilla.</i></li>
</ol>

<strong>Step 3 : Install the font </strong>

I use several fonts for my custom stylesheet.
<ol>
<li> <a href="https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/roboto">Roboto</a></li>
<li> <a href="https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/bebas-neue">Bebas Neue</a></li>
<li> <a href="http://www.freejapanesefont.com/bokutachi-gothic-2-bold/">Bokutachi no Gothic 2 </a></li>
</ol>

<strong>Step 4 : Show your appreciation </strong>
<ol>
<li>Feel free to comment this deviation (critique, suggestion, compliment, etc).</li>
<li>If you like my works, don't hesitate to watch me.</li>
<li>You can share it, but don't forget to mention me.</li>
</ol>

Trivia
-------------------------------

I decided to name the script <i>Atmosphere-O</i> because they're a lot of different things you can find here from amazing painting, lewd arts, realistic drawing to cute things, thus Atmosphere. The <i>O</i> comes from Ozone, which you can find in the atmosphere, but I put this because it sounds cool to be honest, and to differentiate it with my previous dA script called <i>Atmosphere</i>.


Report
-------------------------------

This script isn't perfect, some parts of the site weren't modified such as the section in Shop or the F.A.Q section. If you find some elements that weren't tweaked or that you simply want to modify or re-add an element that was removed, don't hesitate to report it in the comments.
